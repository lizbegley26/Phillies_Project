# Phillies_Project

Welcome to my Questionnaire Solutions!
 
**Question A:**
I included both a PDF version and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) version of my solution. These are identical - feel free to open whichever version is easiest for you.
 
**Question B:**
I included both a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) as well the actual python code (.py) if you’d like to run it yourself. If you are running it on your local machine, the following may need to be installed:
pip3 install lxml
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install -U matplotlib


Lastly, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to look at my project! I had a lot of fun with this. 

If I were to have more time, my next steps would include creating a simple site to display the qualifying offer calculated, as well as a few of my tables/graphs. I also would allow a user to enter the departing free agent’s statistics so that they could be included in the graphs to help visualize where they fall compared to other the other players.

Thank you!
